            <p>Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of someone else's computer to mine cryptocurrency. Hackers do this by either getting the victim to click on a malicious link in an email that loads cryptomining code on the computer or by infecting a website or online ad with JavaScript code that auto-executes once loaded in the victim's browser.</p>

            <h2 id="how-it-works-heading">How Does Cryptojacking Work?</h2>
            <p>Cryptojacking scripts use the processing power of the infected computer or device to mine for cryptocurrencies, which are then sent to the hacker's account. The victim is often unaware of the attack, although they may notice a decrease in performance or increased electricity usage.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Install ad blockers or anti-cryptomining extensions.</li>
                <li>Keep your software and antivirus updated.</li>
                <li>Avoid clicking on suspicious links or emails.</li>
                <li>Monitor your device’s performance for any unusual activity.</li>

            <p>Cryptojacking is a growing cybersecurity threat capable of targeting a wide range of devices, including computers, smartphones, tablets, and even Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Once a device is infiltrated, the cryptojacking script silently hijacks its processing power to mine cryptocurrencies, directing the profits to the hacker’s account while often remaining undetected by the victim.</p>
